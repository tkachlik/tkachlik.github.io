      <h1>Curiousity for the sake of curiosity is the best kind</h1>
      
      <p>Feeling smart? Great! Feels good, right? However, let's not get too comfy. Complacency is to be avoided at all costs!<br>
      Whether it is learning something new, trying to become an expert in a well-known field, or letting yourself still be surprised as a research veteran,<br>
      you always want to remember the key to being really smart, i.e. knowing you're not quite as smart as you'd like to think.<br>
      The more you know about how much you don't know, the more uncertain on the one hand, yet the more complex and wonderful on the other your world gets.<br>
      To put it poetically (and I am stealing this wisdom from an unknown author):<br>
      We can either be a big person in a small world, or have the courage to be a pigmy in an infinite universe.</p>

      <p>Unlike the case of the Schrodinger's cat, a person cannot be simultaneously knowledgeable and ignorant of a topic.<br>
          Should you be so inclined, accept your role in the universe as an object too large for quantum states, and pick which one you want to be.<br>
          And most importantly, have fun! :)</p>
