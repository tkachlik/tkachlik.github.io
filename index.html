      <h1>Tom Kachel</h1>
      <h2>A newcomer to the IT scene, an aspiring junior developer</h2>      
      <p>Hello World! After four years of corporate experience at DHL Express Czech Republic, I have decided to earn a hard skill that would do two things for me:
      <br> (1) give me the chance to get a job that is more of a passion for me, solving problems creatively while being analytical and working in the realm of the abstract and digital;
      <br> (2) provide me with a skill set more easily and universally marketable to add to my current set of mostly soft skills.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy a good story, be it an audiovisual or a more traditionally narrated one, as well as music.
      <br> Apart from being a consumer, I like to step onto the stage with a stand-up bit, or write a story where there only used to be a blank page.
      <br> With programming, it is much the same magic - with a language, we get to create amazing things from nothing.</p>
